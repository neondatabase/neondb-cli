Add support for VS Code and Claude CLI in addition to Cursor. The CLI now:

-   Automatically detects which editors are installed on your system
-   Allows you to select and configure multiple editors at once
-   Supports VS Code with global (or workspace-level as a fallback) MCP configuration
-   Supports Claude CLI with global MCP configuration

-   Refactored Neon guidelines to use a separate `neon.md` file instead of adding bulk content to `AGENTS.md`
-   `AGENTS.md` now contains only a minimal reference that triggers when users say "Get started with Neon"
-   Added confirmation prompt when replacing existing `neon.md` files
-   Check for Cursor installation and provide helpful feedback when Cursor isn't installed

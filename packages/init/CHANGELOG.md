# neon-init

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0174963: **Agent guidelines now served via MCP resource**

  Removed AGENTS.md and .neon/AGENTS.md file creation logic. Agent guidelines are now provided directly by the Neon MCP Server as an MCP resource, eliminating the need to create local files in user projects.

  Changes:

  - Removed functions for creating AGENTS.md and .neon/AGENTS.md files
  - Removed organization fetching and selection (no longer needed for local files)
  - Simplified the CLI flow to only configure the MCP server
  - Updated README to reflect that guidelines are built into the MCP server
  - Reduced bundle size by ~19%

  Users should now use "Get started with Neon using MCP Resource" to access the interactive onboarding flow.

  - Require LLMs to read .env before modifying it and use append commands when files are unreadable
  - Update established project guidance to automatically integrate installed drivers with existing code
  - Clean up output during authentication flow based on user feedback
